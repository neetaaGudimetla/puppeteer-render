Something went wrong :Error: Could not find Chromium (rev. 1108766). This can occur if either 1. you did not perform an installation before running the script (e.g. `npm install`) or 2. your cache path is incorrectly configured (which is: /opt/render/.cache/puppeteer).

Jun 10 11:04:49 AM    Puppeteer old Headless deprecation warning:
Jun 10 11:04:49 AM      In the near feature `headless: true` will default to the new Headless mode

Jun 10 11:04:49 AM      information, please see https://developer.chrome.com/articles/new-headless/.
Jun 10 11:04:49 AM      Consider opting in early by passing `headless: "new"` to `puppeteer.launch()`
